## Application Development Process

---
class: center, middle

### Monolithic architecture

---
class: center, middle

A monolithic application is built as a single unit.

---

Typical enterprise applications are built in three parts:

- A database â€” consisting of many tables usually in a relational database management system

- A client-side user interface â€” consisting of HTML pages and/or JavaScript running in a browser)

- A server-side application â€” which will handle HTTP requests, execute domain-specific logic, retrieve and update data from the database, and populate the HTML views to be sent to the browser.

---

![Monolith Logic](assets/images/monolith-logic.jpg)

---
class: center, middle

Monolith apps allow you to set your deployment once and then simply adjust it based on ongoing changes.

---

#### Benefits of Monolith

- Simple to develop â€” At the beginning of a project it is much easier to go with Monolithic Architecture.

- Simple to test. For example, you can implement end-to-end testing by simply launching the application and testing the UI with Selenium.

- Simple to deploy. You have to copy the packaged application to a server.

- Simple to scale horizontally by running multiple copies behind a load balancer.

---
class: center, middle

![Monolith eCom](assets/images/monolith-ecom.jpg)

---
class: center, middle

*Makes it simple to deploy*

---

#### Drawbacks of Monolith

- Tight coupling between components

- Maintenance â€” If Application is too large and complex to understand entirely, it is challenging to make changes fast and correctly.

- The size of the application can slow down the start-up time.

- You must redeploy the entire application on each update.

- Monolithic applications can also be challenging to scale when different modules have conflicting resource requirements.

- Reliability â€” Bug in any module (e.g. memory leak) can potentially bring down the entire process. Moreover, since all instances of the application are identical, that bug impact the availability of the entire application

- Regardless of how easy the initial stages may seem, Monolithic applications have difficulty to adopting new and advance technologies.

---
class: center, middle

Since changes in languages or frameworks affect an entire application, it requires efforts to thoroughly work with the app details, hence it is costly considering both time and efforts.

---
class: center, middle

*Harder to build and maintain parts of application by multiple teams*

---
class: center, middle

### Building an application in a microservice architecture

---
class: center, middle

*Microservices are better suited to scalability*

---
class: center, middle

![Monolith vs Microservice](assets/images/monolith-vs-microservice.jpg)

---

#### Benefits of Microservices

- Enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.

- Better testability â€” services are smaller and faster to test.

- Better deployability â€” services can be deployed independently.

- It enables you to organize the development effort around multiple teams. Each team is responsible for one or more single service. Each team can develop, deploy and scale their services independently of all of the other teams.

- Each microservice is relatively small

.content-credits[https://medium.com/koderlabs/introduction-to-monolithic-architecture-and-microservices-architecture-b211a5955c63]

---

- Comfortable for a developer to understand

- The IDE is faster making developers more productive

- The application starts faster, which makes developers more productive, and speeds up deployments

- Improved fault isolation. For example, if there is a memory leak in one service then only that service is affected. The other services continue to handle requests. In comparison, one misbehaving component of a monolithic architecture can bring down the entire system.

- Eliminates any long-term commitment to a technology stack. When developing a new service you can pick a new technology stack. Similarly, when making major changes to an existing service you can rewrite it using a new technology stack.

[OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec)

The Open Container Initiative develops specifications for standards on Operating System process and application containers.

class: center, middle

`docker run hello-world`

---

### Primer

![Architecture](assets/images/architecture.svg)

.image-credits[https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/]

---
class: center, middle

### Containers

---
class: center, middle

![Container Analogy](assets/images/container-analogy.png)

---

- Using `docker run`, to start a container

- Using `docker ps`, to view status of containers

- Using `docker stop`, to stop a container

- Using `docker rm`, to remove a stopped container

---
class: center, middle

*Exercise*: Run a linux container, create a file inside it and stop it

---
class: center, middle

Containers are *ephemeral*

---
class: center, middle

### Images

---

#### Key concepts

- Image is the definition of what a **container** is created from.

- Images are **immutable**. If you make changes, a new image must be built.

- Images are made of **layers**.

- Images are **inherited** from **base images** and can be many levels deep.

- `docker images`

.content-credits[https://www.vergeops.com/]

---
class: center, middle

#### Dockerfile

Or `dockerfile`, `my-dockerfile`, ...

---

- Use `Dockerfile`

  - *Infrastructure as Code*

  - All images are based on other images as their parent.

  - You must choose a parent, or `FROM` image.

  - `scratch` is the base empty image supplied by Docker.

  - Base images include all settings, files, what command runs at startup, etc.

- Create an image using

  - `docker build`

---

Here is the format of the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments
```

---

Eg. [`hello-world`'s `Dockerfile`](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world)

```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY hello /
CMD ["/hello"]
```

---

#### Other Commands

There are just a handful of simple `Instructions`:

```bash
FROM # which image this inherits from
LABEL # custom information
WORKDIR # Change to a directory until changed again.
  # Works like cd
USER # Change to a user
RUN # Run a Linux command in a new layer.
  # The command is dependent on which shell is in the image.
EXPOSE # Tells what ports this container will listen on.
  # Does not actually publish a port, but is rather like documentation.
ADD # copy files into the container
COPY # copy files into the container.
  # Similar to ADD
ENTRYPOINT # The command to be run when container is started.
  # This is inherited from a base image.
CMD # provides defaults to be run after the ENTRYPOINT.
  # Also inherited from the base image.
```

[More...](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

---

#### Layers

- Images are made of **layers**.

- Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` adds a layer. (*True* for older Docker installations)

- When pushing/pulling an image to a repository (more to come), only the **changed layers** are pushed to save bandwidth.

- When building an image, Docker steps through the instructions in your Dockerfile, executing each in the order specified.

---
class: center, middle

Only the instructions *RUN, COPY, ADD* create layers.

.image-credits[https://www.vergeops.com/]

---

#### Image Tags

- You can uniquely identify an image using a tag name

- `docker build -t <image-name>:<tag-name> .`

- `latest` is the default tag name

---
class: center, middle

*Optional Exercise*: Create a `hello-world` image, similar to [`hello-haskell`](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/DockerTraining/tree/master/examples/0-hello-world/hello-haskell)

### Registry

---

- Many options: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Container Registry, ...

- Default: https://hub.docker.com/

- Private repository...

---

#### Pulling from a repository

`docker pull hello-world`

---

#### Pushing to a repository

`docker push <image-name>:<tag-name>`

---
class: center, middle

*Optional Exercise*: [Push the `hello-world` image to hub](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/DockerTraining/blob/master/challenges/pushing-to-remote-repo.md), ask a participant to run it on their system

### Kubernetes Architecture

![Components](assets/images/components-of-kubernetes.png)

---
class: center, middle

### Control Plane Components

Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all control plane components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.

---
class: center, middle

### Worker Plane components - Nodes

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

---
class: center, middle

### K8s - CLI Tools

---

#### `kubeadm`

- The `kubeadm` tool helps you [bootstrap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/) a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices.

  *In fact, you can use `kubeadm` to set up a cluster that will pass the [Kubernetes Conformance tests](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/10/software-conformance-certification/).*

- A simple way for you to try out Kubernetes, possibly for the first time.

- A way for existing users to automate setting up a cluster and test their application.

- A building block in other ecosystem and/or installer tools with a larger scope.

.content-credits[https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/]

---

#### `kubectl`

- The `kubectl` command line tool lets you control Kubernetes clusters.

- For configuration, kubectl looks for a file named `config` in the `$HOME/.kube` directory.

- You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by setting the `--kubeconfig` flag.

- Makes it reasonably easy to work with multiple clusters using: `kubectl config` & `contexts`

.content-credits[https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/]

---

#### [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

- command line tool which allows for simulating a multi node k8s cluster
